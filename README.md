# : Interaction Design COM525

### Why is this unit important?
Interaction Design (IxD) is a discipline related to User Centred Design (UCD), Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and User Experience (UX), it plays an important role when designing digital products and services. Interaction Design is focused on creating engaging accessible interfaces which will allow a user to interact seamlessly through a digital system in an empathetic way, to access information, products and services.

### What you will learn on the unit
You will gain knowledge of the underpinning theory and current professional practice in the interaction design discipline. Although there will be a focus on experimentation, you will be guided to current guidelines for content accessibility and International standards for ergonomics of human-system interaction. 
 
### Guidelines covered will address:
•	Learnability & Understandability - how intuitive an interface is to navigate
•	Operability - how much control the user has
•	Attractiveness - how appealing the interface design is
•	Usability compliance - how the interface adheres to current standards. 
 
Other topic areas covered, but not limited to, will include navigation, affordance, motion design, animation, web components, design assets, design systems, mental models, errors, user feedback, interface metaphors, consistency, gestures, voice interfaces, contemporary web applications, design thinking, design sprints, testing evaluation and feedback.

### How you will learn
Learning activities will be based on real-world scenarios, preparing you for employment or career progression.

The lecture will present Interaction Design theory, current guidelines and practice. The practical sessions will offer technical instruction on how you can get started with Identifying, analysing and evaluating Interaction Design problems, these sessions will consist of both independent and group tasks.

Once you have established an overview of the theory of interaction design and are confident in applying current guidelines, you will identify interaction design problems and suggest solutions using appropriate current technologies and workflows.

### How much time the unit requires: 
You are expected to study for 200 hours (which equates to 10 hours per credit.  This total learning time is made up of contact time, directed learning tasks, independent learning and assessment activity. Your tutor will offer you guidance on how you should best manage your study time on this unit.

### How you will be assessed
Tasks which help you to learn and prepares you for summative tasks (Formative):
You will undertake tutor led weekly tasks to support the design of the five interactive components required in the summative portfolio and with the opportunity to receive ongoing feedback.  Set milestones throughout the semester will offer feedback on each of the portfolio components. 
 
You will be required to communicate your ideas to peers and external design practitioners to gain feedback to justify your approaches showing results and personal reflection in the summative portfolio.

### Tasks which count towards your degree (Summative):
You will create a portfolio of five design Interaction components that offer design solutions to real-world problems. Your portfolio will be supported by 3000 words which will define and justify your approaches, document your process and present the results from feedback/evaluation.

### When assessment does not go to plan
If you do not pass the portfolio, you will have to resubmit your work after improving it based on feedback from your tutor.

### What you will be able to do after the unit
1.	Discuss and compare the range of common standards in current interaction design over different systems and devices.
2.	Analyse interaction designs to identify principles that underpin user experiences and evaluate new experimental approaches.
3.	Use research and technical skills to produce interactive interface components that are fit for purpose within the environment of professional workflows. 
4.	Confidently communicate and justify ideas to team members and clients with reference to relevant concepts, design principles and current standards.
5.	Reflect constructively to feedback, personal objectives and accept responsibility for outcomes.
6.	Create usable and accessible digital products that solve real-world problems to current industry standards
