### Assessment Task

You will apply interaction design theory and current guidelines to create a portfolio of five design interaction components that offer design solutions to real-world problems. Your online interactive portfolio will be supported by 3000 words which will define and justify your approaches, document your process and present the results from feedback/evaluation.

Each of your interactive components will need to present:

* Research
* Evaluation of guidelines
* Planning & design prototyping
* Coding
* A video and/or screencast walkthrough of the component working
* Feedback & reflection
* Approximately 600 words of documentation per component)

### Your portfolio will cover and Address the following areas:

1.	Discussion and comparison of a range of common standards in current interaction design that applies to different systems and devices.
2.	Analysis of interaction design to identify principles that underpin user experiences and evaluate new experimental approaches.
3.	Presentation of research and application of technical skills.
4.	Justification of relevant concepts, design principles and current standards used.
5.	Constructive reflection on feedback, personal objectives and accept responsibility for outcomes.
6.	Creation of usable and accessible digital products that solve real-world problems to current industry standards


### Production of Portfolio 

Your portfolio will be presented online, what platform you used is up to you, but it needs to be presented in a current professional manner.

### Submission of Portfolio

You will need to submit a PDF or screen captures of your portfolio together with the URL of its location.

**Learning Outcomes:** This assessment will enable students to demonstrate in full or in part the learning outcomes identified in the Module descriptors.

**Late Submissions:** Students are reminded that:

1. If this assessment is submitted late i.e. within 5 working days of the submission deadline, the mark will be capped at 40% if a pass mark is achieved;

1.	If this assessment is submitted later than 5 working days after the submission deadline, the work will be regarded as a non-submission and will be awarded a zero;

1.	If this assessment is being submitted as a referred piece of work (second or third attempt) then it must be submitted by the deadline date; any Refer assessment submitted late will be regarded as a non-submission and will be awarded a zero.

**Extenuating Circumstances:** The University’s Extenuating Circumstances procedure is in place if there are genuine circumstances that may prevent a student submitting an assessment. If students are not 'fit to study’, they can either request an extension to the submission deadline of 5 working days or they can request to submit the assessment at the next opportunity (Defer).  In both instances students must submit an EC application with relevant evidence.   If accepted by the EC Panel there will be no academic penalty for late submission or non-submission dependent on what is requested.  Students are reminded that EC covers only short term issues (20 working days) and that if they experience longer term matters that impact on learning then they must contact the Student Hub for advice.

Please find a link to the EC policy below:[https://students.solent.ac.uk/official-documents/quality-management/academic-handbook/2p-extenuating-circumstances.pdf] (https://students.solent.ac.uk/official-documents/quality-management/academic-handbook/2p-extenuating-circumstances.pdf)

**Academic Misconduct:** Any submission must be students’ own work and, where facts or ideas have been used from other sources, these sources must be appropriately referenced. The University’s Academic Handbook includes the definitions of all practices that will be deemed to constitute academic misconduct.  Students should check this link before submitting their work.

Procedures relating to student academic misconduct are given below: [https://students.solent.ac.uk/official-documents/quality-management/academic-handbook/4l-student-academic-misconduct-procedure.pdf] (https://students.solent.ac.uk/official-documents/quality-management/academic-handbook/4l-student-academic-misconduct-procedure.pdf)

**Ethics Policy:** The work being carried out by students must be in compliance with the Ethics Policy. Where there is an ethical issue, as specified within the Ethics Policy, then students will need an ethics release or an ethical approval prior to the start of the project.

The Ethics Policy is contained within Section 2S of the Academic Handbook [https://staff.solent.ac.uk/official-documents/quality-management/academic-handbook/2s-solent-university-ethics-policy.pdf](https://staff.solent.ac.uk/official-documents/quality-management/academic-handbook/2s-solent-university-ethics-policy.pdf)

**Grade marking:** The University uses a letter grade scale for the marking of assessments. Unless students have been specifically informed otherwise their marked assignment will be awarded a letter grade. More detailed information on grade marking and the grade scale can be found on the portal and in the Student Handbook.
